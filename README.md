# First-website

Project Goal
I am a student in my second semester of studying Artificial Intelligence. This is my first website project. It features a chatbot that helps people book a table at a restaurant. Right now, the website does not save the booking data, but I will add a database for storage later this year.

The Website Files
All the main website files are inside the public folder. This folder contains the HTML for the structure, the CSS for the design, and the script for the functions. I used jQuery to build the chatbot's brain. All the answers the bot gives to the user are written directly inside this jQuery file. This makes the chat feel fast and interactive.

Project Logic and Structure
The project uses several other files to work correctly:

Bot and Fallback: The bot file handles the normal conversation. If the user says something the bot does not know, the fallback file takes over to help the user get back on track.

Base and StaticExpress: The base file holds the general settings for the project. The staticExpress file is what allows the website to run and show the files from the public folder on your screen.

Test: I use the test file to check for mistakes. It makes sure the jQuery logic and the chatbot answers work perfectly before anyone uses the site.

How to Start
To see the website, open the public folder and launch the index.html file. You can start chatting with the bot immediately to see how it handles restaurant bookings.
